# Topological Optimization of barcodes - Deforming Point Clouds to Control Persistent Homology

## Code environment setup

For setting up the code environment we suggest using conda, as it is the most convenient.

You can use the following command for setting up the conda env with the needed dependencies:

```sh
conda create -n topological-optimization python=3.13 ripser numpy scipy
```

and then activating it with:

```sh
conda activate topological-optimization
```
